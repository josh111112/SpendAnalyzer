# SpendAnalyzer
This is a spending analyizer that takes in a csv file specifically from USAA. This is useful incase your USAA built in analyzer doesn't work. All you need to do is change the file_name variable to the csv file you downloaded and run it.
The category_mappings file is there incasae there are hundreds of "Category Pending" cases for your data.
